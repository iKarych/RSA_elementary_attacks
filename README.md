# RSA_elementary_attacks

## Introduction
This repository briefly expoits RSA algorithm using 3 elementary attacks:
- Common Modulus Attack
- Direct Root Attack
- Hastad's Broadcast Attack on unpadded messages

## How to use
To try out any of the attacks, run encrypt.py in the chosen attack. It will use [this](lorem_ipsum.txt) message as plain text.
To decrypt the message, run decrypt.py. You should be able to see decrypted plain text message
